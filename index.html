							<div class="content" style="flex: 1 1 auto; text-align: left;">
								<p>Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Vasupradha Ramji and I live in Windermere, Florida. I am currently a rising Sophomore at the University of Central Florida and major in Computer Science. My passions lie within computer software, applied sciences, mathematics, and literature. In my free time, I can usually be found with my nose in a book or engaged with any kind of puzzle. I enjoy learning anything new, whether it is skills or hobbies to pick up in everyday life or in academics, which has in turn propelled me into picking up new ideas quickly. While I do not yet know specifically which direction I will take in the future within the field of computer science, I am most enthralled by artificial intelligence and desire to someday work with it and contribute to machine learning. Regardless of what profession I decide to pursue, I have always aspired to go above and beyond on anything that I take on.</p>

											<h3>Mythology Project Website</h3>
											<p>Attached below is the link to my ENC1102 research portfolio on mythology. The final part of the project was encapsulated by the design of a personal website to showcase each step in my research into various types of mythology, involving several different modes, as well as my conclusions. I had designed this website through Wix, but it has allowed me to gain valuable experience in building a navigatable website.</p>

											<h3>Breaking Down the "N-Knights" Problem in Chess</h3>
											<p>Through my Introduction to Discrete Structures course at UCF, I had been given the opportunity to formulate a research question revolving around a topic in Discrete Mathematics, with a connection to Computer Science, and had decide to experiment with the N-Queen Problem in Chess, except rather than the typical Queen piece, I had coded a variation with Knights. I had found backtracking and recursion to be the optimal strategy to code this problem. Throughout the process, I had documented my background research, methods, results, and conclusions in the form of a research paper.</p>
